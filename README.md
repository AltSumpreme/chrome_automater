# chrome_automater
This Python script utilizes the PyAutoGUI library, along with the keyboard and time modules, to automate the Chrome Dinosaur Game. The Chrome Dinosaur Game is a hidden gem that appears when your browser detects no internet connection. This project enhances the gaming experience by automating the dinosaur's jump over obstacles.
# Prerequisites
To run the script successfully, make sure you have the required libraries installed. 
pyautogui
keyboard
time
# Usage
1.Open the Chrome browser and navigate to a webpage with no internet connection to trigger the Dinosaur Game.
2.Run the Python script.
3.The script will automatically control the dinosaur's jump using PyAutoGUI, simulating key presses with the keyboard module.
Note: For optimal performance, it is recommended to use the Chrome browser in dark mode. If using a light background, modify the script by changing the RGB value (32) to 225 for the pixel detection, ensuring accurate obstacle recognition.

Feel free to customize the code further to suit your preferences or experiment with different background modes. Happy gaming!
